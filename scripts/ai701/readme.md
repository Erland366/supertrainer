We use [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/tree/main) to train DeepseekVL, Internvl, and Deepseek Janus.

To run the script, simply run
`bash train_swift.sh <model_name>`

But you should format your dataset and save them as `train.jsonl`. The dataset format for each model can be found in [ms-swift documentation](swift.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
